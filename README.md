Dojo Carousel Widget
=============


Once your script is in place, edit `lib/github/markups.rb` and tell
GitHub Markup about it. Again we look to [rest2html][r2hc] for
guidance:

    command(:rest2html, /re?st(.txt)?/)

Here we're telling GitHub Markup of the existence of a `rest2html`
command which should be used for any file ending in `rest`,
`rst`, `rest.txt` or `rst.txt`. Any regular expression will do.
